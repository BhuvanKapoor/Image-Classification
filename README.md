# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification

This repository contains code and resources for an image classification project that distinguishes between images of dogs and cats using the Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of a training set of 25,000 images equally divided between dogs and cats. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify new images as either dogs or cats.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

1. `data/train/`: This folder contains the training images for dogs and cats.
2. `data/test1/`: This folder contains a test set of images to evaluate the model's performance.
3. `dogs_vs_cats.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the code in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
